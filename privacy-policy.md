# Privacy Policy and Terms of Use for IP Camera Screensaver

Effective Date: January 30, 2025

This document outlines how IP Camera Screensaver ("we", "our", or "the app") handles user information and the terms of use.

## Data Collection and Usage
IP Camera Screensaver does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The only information stored within the app is:
- Your RTSP stream URL, which is saved locally on your device using Android's SharedPreferences
- App settings (such as audio preferences), which are also stored locally on your device

## Camera Stream Access
The app displays RTSP video streams that you configure. These streams are:
- Accessed directly between your device and your camera system
- Not recorded or stored by the app
- Not transmitted to any third parties
- Only accessible while your device is on the same network as your camera system

## Third-Party Services
The app does not use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.

## Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability
By downloading, installing, or using IP Camera Screensaver, you agree that:
- The app is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied
- The developers shall not be liable for any damages, including but not limited to direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the app
- Any issues related to camera connectivity, network performance, or video quality are beyond the developers' control
- The security of your camera system and its credentials remains your responsibility
- The developers are not responsible for any potential security breaches or unauthorized access to your camera system

## Data Security
Since all data is stored locally on your device, security of your RTSP credentials depends on your device's security. We recommend:
- Using your device's built-in security features (screen lock, biometrics)
- Keeping your device's operating system updated
- Using secure network connections

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy as needed. Any changes will be reflected in the "Effective Date" above.
